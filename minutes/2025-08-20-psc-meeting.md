## Agenda

- OGC community standard looks like it's passing
  - Voting closes 22 August.
  - We're going to wait until STAC API v1.0.1 (or v1.1) before submitting STAC v1.1 as another community standard
- STAC sprint organization continuing apace, including coordination with the [Zarr adopter days](https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/join-us-for-zarr-adopter-days-on-october-16-17-in-rome-italy/5356)
- There is a non-insignificant amount of funds earmarked for STAC activities in the Radiant Earth account.
  No decisions were made on how to spend it, but we should not continue to just sit on it.
- Free-form discussion on the future of STAC.
