## Minutes

### Funding and PSC purpose

- Discussed STAC PSC's relationship with the [Cloud-Native Geospatial (CNG) Forum](https://cloudnativegeo.org/), and whether CNG should work like [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/) and have "sponsored projects" (e.g. [numpy](https://numfocus.org/project/numpy)).
  (note: NumFocus provides funding and resources as well)
- Decided on five overarching goals for the PSC:
  - Interface with CNG, Radiant Earth, and any other organizations and standards bodies (e.g. [OGC](https://www.ogc.org/))
  - Create and publish a roadmap for the STAC spec, the STAC API spec, and the STAC ecosystem
  - Filter and publicly identify issues and problems in the STAC ecosystem, and moderate resolutions to those problems when necessary
  - Identify and solve core specification issues
  - Provide and participate in forums for the community to discuss and work with STAC

### Communications

- Accepted motion (@gadomski, second @matthewhanson) move "permanent, threaded discussions" to the [CNG Discourse](https://cng.discourse.group) and disable Github discussions for [stac-spec](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/discussions) and [stac-api-spec](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/discussions)
  - Other organizations and repositories can choose to follow suit, but they don't have to
  - @gadomski will coordinate the transition
- @PowerChell will ask CNG to open Slack so that we can move STAC discussions there (currently on [Gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog_Lobby:gitter.im))
- @jsignell will update the website to point to the community meetings and the appropriate CNG Discourse channel
- @PowerChell to schedule next PSC meeting, thereafter next meeting will be scheduled before ending current meeting
- Accepted motion (@matthewhanson, second @jsignell) to delete the STAC Twitter account
  - @PowerChell to coordinate transfer ownership of STAC Twitter, STAC LinkedIn from CNG
  - @PowerChell to delete STAC Twitter
  - @PowerChell to coordinate transfer of STAC domain to STAC PSC
  - @m-mohr to set up STAC extension domain redirect
  - @gadomski to make STAC Bluesky

### Community meetings

- ([see above](#communications)) Publicize on website
- @alexgleith to schedule monthly STAC community meetings in Australia-friendly timezone

### STAC as an OGC community standards

- @alexgleith to reach out and lean on [v1.0 process](https://www.ogc.org/requests/ogc-seeks-public-comment-on-adoption-of-stac-and-stac-api-as-community-standards/), as well as kick of v1.1 process
