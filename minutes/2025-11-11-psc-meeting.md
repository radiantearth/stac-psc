## Agenda

- We're deprecating Gitter in favor of the `#stac` channel in the [Cloud-Native Geospatial Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cloudnativegeo/shared_invite/zt-2i37pc3nm-9bXiRHYrI6fH5qFh2VaLFA).
  @m-mohr has pinned a message in Gitter notifying members of the change.
  The [current communication channels](https://stacspec.org/en/get-involved/) for STAC are:
    - The `#stac` channel CNG Slack for announcements, chats, questions, and informal conversations.
    - [Discussions](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/discussions) on the STAC specification Github repository for more formal conversations and requests for comments.
    - The [STAC Community Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/cloudnativegeo.org/g/stac-community?pli=1) and its associated STAC Community Meetings for sync chats.
- There will be a three day STAC sprint before next year's FOSS4G in Japan.
  We're reaching out to contacts there to begin planning.
- We'll be doing a one-day mini-sprint before next year's Cloud-Native Geospatial conference in Snowbird, UT.
- We discussed updating the [maturity classifications](https://stac-extensions.github.io/#grouped-by-maturity) for STAC extensions, and decided on a rough framework.
  The next steps will be to write up this as a proposal/request-for-comment and solicit feedback from the community
  The proposed levels are:
  - "Foundational/Core/Operational/Supported" (maintained, used in best practices, stable, implemented in common open source tooling, …) - decided by PSC
  - "Stable/Mature/Community/Unsupported/Pilot" - (no breaking changes expected frequently) - decided by maintainers
  - "Proposed" (evolves, looking, breaking changes expected) - decided by maintainers
  - "Deprecated" - decided by PSC (if released before)
