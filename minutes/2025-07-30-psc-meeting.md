## Agenda

  - Agenda: <https://github.com/radiantearth/community-sprints/tree/main/14102025-esrin-rome-italy>
  - There will be some overlap with a coincident (in time and in space) Zarr sprint
- OGC community standard voting has begun
- Looking at an August start for an Australia Community Meeting
- We will discuss existing STAC funds at the next meeting
- Free-form discussion around whether the PSC care about [stac-geoparquet](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-geoparquet), from a specification perspective?
  Conclusion was the PSC isn’t responsible for Actual Work™, but we can help influence the extension/community space
- Ongoing PSC-level work around [stac-profiles](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/discussions/1353)
- Free-form discussion on whether there's space around a "certification" model for STAC implementations, no real conclusions
